# THE GAME 1
In-class, sequential game activity.

## A game within THE GAME
In this activity, we'll be working in groups to program a sequential game with user input. You may select one of the following games or propose your own (with approval from the Prof):

 - **Hi-Lo** - Players are presented a sequence of cards from a shuffled deck. They guess whether the subsequent card will be higher or lower. How long can you keep a streak alive? 
 - **Blackjack** - The classic casino game, players compete against a computer dealer to get their cards to sum close to 21 without going over.
 - **Simon** - Players are challenged to memorize a list of colors/letters/numbers. Each time they get it right, the list grows by one. How long a list can you memorize?
 - **Wordle** - Players guess a 5-letter mystery word. After each guess, they get feedback telling them which letters they got right and in the right place, right but in the wrong place, or just plain wrong.

## The Rules of THE GAME
 - Teams of 3 or 4 students. Include your team name and team members in the top cell of your notebook.
 - One scribe per team (the student that writes the final code).
 - At max, one CS student per team (unless the numbers do not allow)
 - The CS student may not be the scribe.
 - You are expected to Google for help, but do not Google the answer.
 - You may send an ambassador to another team for help or raise your hand to ask a question of the whole class.
 - You are not permitted to use any GenAI for this activity.
 - This activity is **not graded**, but I am going to ask you to submit your team work at the end of the class.

## Advice
 - Before you begin coding, discuss the rules and features of the game you're programming. Make sure everyone understands what you're aiming to do.
 - Write out a draft of how you plan to code the game in English or pseudo-code. There will be steps you don't know how to do. Divy up the research on how to accomplish those goals.
 - You will likely need to import packages we haven't used before. Googling what you want to achieve will often lead you to the package you need (add keywords like 'python' and 'jupyter' to get language-specific advice).
 - Start simple. You don't have to implement every feature of the game, and certainly not all from the start. Start simple and flesh it out as you go. It's fun to add bells and whistles, but get a rough prototype first.
